# SARC: Straid Agent Routing and Coordination

**SARC** is an open protocol and lightweight framework for routing messages between independent AI agents.

Instead of tightly coupled tools, SARC allows agents built with different libraries â€” like HuggingFace, LangChain, or OpenAI â€” to speak the same language via a shared communication format and a simple routing mechanism.

This project is early-stage but growing fast. It's designed with modularity in mind: agents donâ€™t need to know anything about each other â€” just how to speak SARC.

## âœ¨ Why SARC?

Building agent-based systems usually means either:

- Reinventing orchestration from scratch
- Locking into a monolithic framework

SARC aims to be neither. It provides a middle layer â€” minimal, transparent, hackable â€” that lets agents run in different runtimes, machines, or clouds while still coordinating intelligently.

## ðŸ§© Core Concepts

- **Message-based architecture**  
  Agents talk by sending structured messages (requests, responses, tasks).

- **Transport-agnostic**  
  Use HTTP, WebSockets, or queues â€” SARC doesn't care.

- **Adapters for any stack**  
  LangChain, HuggingFace, OpenAI â€” just plug and route.

- **Stateless or stateful**  
  Agents can hold memory or be ephemeral.

- **Intent-based routing (SAO model)**  
  Every message carries a `subject`, `action`, and `object`.
